Forked to try to make it work in 2021, after digging up some old work from 2013, following [these instructions (french)](http://www.journaldulapin.com/2013/02/10/lire-le-contenu-cache-dun-pass-navigo-sur-un-mac/) at the time.

Can't get sConnect to work, though.

Check atr/lib/calypso/locationid.pl for more station ids for navigo.
The list in there was compiled from http://aurelienb.pagesperso-orange.fr/HTML/transports/obli_metro.htm
